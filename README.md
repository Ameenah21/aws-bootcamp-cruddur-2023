# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp

- Application: Cruddur
- Cohort: 2023-A1
I am participating in the Free AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by [Andrew Brown](https://github.com/omenking)
## About the BootCamp
A startup company has decided to build their own micro-blogging platform and has hired you to be its first cloud engineer.
The company paid a web-development firm to translate their wireframe designs into a mock web-application for the purpose of demoing to raise capital.
After a successful round of funding, I will be the Cloud Engineer who has been tasked with taking the mock web-application and making it production ready at scale.
This is the starting codebase that will be used in the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp 2023
